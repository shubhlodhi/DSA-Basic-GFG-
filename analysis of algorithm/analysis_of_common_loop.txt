Analysis of Common Loops: While Loop in Python

Loops are essential constructs in programming that allow us to repeat a block of code multiple times. Python offers several types of loops, and one of the most versatile is the while loop. The while loop continues to execute a block of code as long as a given condition remains true. In this article, we will analyze and demonstrate the use of the while loop for subtraction, multiplication, exponentiation, and nested loops in Python.

 

Addition using a While Loop
Let's begin by examining how to utilize a while loop for addition. The following code demonstrates a simple implementation of adding two numbers using a while loop:

def add(a, b):
    result = a
    while b > 0:
        result += 1
        print(result)
        b -= 1
    	

# Example usage
a = 10
b = 7
add(a,b)

Output
11
12
13
14
15
16
17
In the code above, we define a function called add that takes two numbers, a and b, as parameters. We initialize the variable result with the value of a. The while loop executes b times, incrementing the result by 1 on each iteration while decrementing b by 1. Finally, the function returns the added value.

Time complexity analysis :

Addition using a While Loop:

Time Complexity: O(b)
Similar to multiplication, the while loop executes b times, where b is the value being added. Thus, the time complexity is linear and proportional to b.
 
Subtraction using a While Loop
Let's start by examining how to use a while loop for subtraction. The following code demonstrates a simple implementation of subtracting two numbers using a while loop:

# code
def subtract(a, b):
    result = a
    while result >= b:
      print(result)
      result -= b
    	

# Example usage
a = 15
b = 7
subtract(a, b)


Output
15
8
In the code above, we define a function called subtract that takes two numbers, a and b, as parameters. We initialize the variable result with the value of a. The while loop continues subtracting b from result until result becomes less than b. Finally, the function returns the subtracted value.

Time complexity analysis :

Subtraction using a While Loop:

Time Complexity: O(a / b)
In the worst case scenario, the number of iterations required to subtract b from a using a while loop is a / b. This assumes that a is significantly larger than b. The time complexity is linear and depends on the magnitude of a and b.
Multiplication using a While Loop
Now let's explore how to perform multiplication using a while loop. The following code demonstrates a basic implementation of multiplying two numbers using a while loop:

def multiply(n, c):
    result = 1
    while result < n:
      print(result)
      result *= c
      

# Example usage
n =32 
c = 2
multiply(n, c)

Output
1
2
4
8
16
In the code above, we define a function called multiply that takes two numbers, n and 1, as parameters. We initialize the variable result with 0. The while loop executes upto result value is not greater thea n , multiply result with c Finally, the function prints the value of multiplication.

Multiplication using a While Loop:

Let's say the number of iteration be K so the value be : 1,C,C^2,C^3,C^K-1
C^K-1< n
K<logn+1
Growth of order is O(logn)
Time Complexity: O(logn)
Exponentiation using a While Loop
Next, let's see how to perform exponentiation using a while loop. The following code demonstrates a basic implementation of calculating the exponentiation of a number using a while loop:

def exponentfun(n, c):
    result = 2
    while result < n:
      print(result)
      result =result** c
      

# Example usage
base = 2
exponent = 32
exponentfun(exponent,base)

Output
2
4
16
In the code above, we define a function called exponentfun that takes two numbers, base and exponent, as parameters. We initialize the variable result with 2. The while loop executes exponent times, multiplying the result by base on each iteration while result is not greater than n or exponent, Finally, the function returns the exponentiated value.

 

Time Complexity  Analysis:

Exponentiation using a While Loop:

Time Complexity: O(loglogn)
if this function iterates K time then values comes up to be 2,2^C,(2^C)^C ... ((2^C)^2...))^C...
2^CK-1<n
C^K-1<log2n
k<loglogn+1
T=O(loglogn)
 Time Complexity: O(loglogn)
Nested While Loops
Python allows the usage of nested loops, including nested while loops. A nested loop is a loop within another loop. This type of loop structure can be useful for handling complex scenarios that require multiple iterations. Here's an example of a nested while loop:

i = 0
while i <= 5:
   j = 1
   while j <= n:      
       j *= 1  
   i += 1

Some constant work is done in the nested loop.

j = 1
   while j <= n:      
       j *= 1 

Time complexity of given nested loop  O(logn) 
In case of nested loop we do multiply time complexity of of both loops
T=O(n)*O(logn)=O(nlogn)
Nested While Loops:

Time Complexity: O(nlogn)
Conclusion
The while loop is a powerful construct in Python that allows us to repeat a block of code as long as a specific condition remains true. In this article, we explored the use of while loops for subtraction, multiplication, exponentiation, and nested loops. By leveraging the flexibility of the while loop, you can implement various algorithms and handle different scenarios efficiently. Keep in mind that while using while loops, it's essential to ensure the condition eventually becomes false to avoid infinite loops.
